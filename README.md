# Intro - About me
This is my first project on GitHub. It is an introduction website about myself that I had to create before attending the full-stack web development course at <a href="https://codaisseur.com/" target="_blank">Codaisseur Academy</a>. The purpose of <a href="https://github.com/Codaisseur/pre-academy-homework" target="_blank">Pre-Academy Homework</a> was to create a personal webpage about myself, deploy it and then share it with my Academy classmates.

# Technologies
For making this project, I used HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. As a text code editor I used Visual Studio.

# Deployment
For deploying the website, I used a free hosting platform called <a href="https://app.netlify.com/drop" target="_blank">Bitballoon</a> which is known now as <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/08/14/announcing-netlify-drop---the-simplicity-of-bitballoon-with-the-added-power-of-netlify/?_ga=2.78522256.542878022.1558607433-348820056.1558607433" target="_blank">Netlify Drop</a>.
